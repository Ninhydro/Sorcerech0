Lux: The Magus King thinks war is the answer. He’s not entirely wrong. But he’s also not ready for what’s coming.
Player (Sad): What do you mean?
Lux: This is where Gawr sleeps. The Holy Beast. Long ago, he helped us to get the sorcerech core
Maya_adult: Wait… really??
Lux: That is what I heard,  but yeah it was made from the power of cyber and magus, and Gawr play a vital role in it 
Nataly: So that’s how they made it.
Lux: But Gawr wasn’t exactly happy about it. Beast instinct. He wanted to keep the power. Fight broke out. We sealed him.
Player (Sad): And now?
Lux: Now Varek wake him up again, in order to use him to rampage Exactlyion town. 
Lux: Gawr is mad and unable to control his power since the Sorcerech incident. It will cause chaos in this town even when he's released. But maybe you can reach him… or survive long enough his anger
