Nataly: Alyra was everything to me. Not just a sister — she was… better. Braver.
Nataly: She saw the cracks in the world before I even knew what to look for.

Player: You… both dreamed of peace.
Nataly: Since we were kids. We'd talk at night — about breaking the cycle,
Nataly: About building world with no war. Even though we hate Magus, killing them is not the way

Maya_adult: What happened?
Nataly: We chose different roads.
Nataly: I joined the Cyber military. Thought if I rose high enough, I could change things from the inside.
Player: And Alyra…?
Nataly: She couldn’t wait. She said the system was too broken. She left. Disobeyed direct orders.
Nataly: To Exactlyion, she became a traitor overnight.
Player: That’s why… the Cyber Elite… wanted her dead.
Nataly: Yeah. They branded her a deserter. A liability.
Nataly: But to me, she's still my sister. I went searching for her ever since she left.
Nataly: The moment I first saw you guys, I know something is up.
Player: You mean with me?
Nataly: Not just you, she'll never fight with another Magus before
Nataly: She believed there was another way. That you were the key to that way.
Nataly: And I… I let her go. I let her fight alone.
Player: She didn’t blame you.
Nataly: She should’ve.
Nataly: I had rank. Access. I could’ve helped from the shadows. But I was scared. Of what I’d lose. By the time I tried to reach her… it was already too late.
Maya_adult: She died protecting something bigger than any of us. She'd be proud of you for standing now.
Nataly: I don’t want pride. I want a second chance…
Player: All of this is because of this Core, it causes so much pain... why can’t we destroy it?
Maya_adult: Phina… If we do that you’ll die
Nataly: Not just that, the Core isn't like a normal artifact. It's fused with mana and electrical energy. Destroying it could cause a huge explosion
Player: So it’s not just dangerous to hold... it’s dangerous to break?
Maya_adult: We’ll find a way Phina, let’s finish what we started, continue what Alyra left…
Nataly: We’ll find the Magus and Cyber leaders.
Nataly: But not as soldiers. Not as rebels.
Nataly: As people carrying the memory of someone who tried.
Maya_adult: And this time, I’m not staying behind. Ten years in the junkyard made me stronger than some battlemages.
Player: You were always strong.
Maya_adult: Not as strong as you, tin queen.
Player: Not queen. Just… trying to be someone worth following.
Nataly: Then it’s decided.
Nataly: We go out there. Talk to the leaders.
Nataly: Show them that the Core isn't a weapon — it’s a responsibility.
Maya_adult: And if they won’t listen?
Nataly: Then we’ll make them.
Player: Ten years ago… I fell. Now, I rise… not as Fini, and not just as Phina.
Player: But as the voice of what they left behind...
