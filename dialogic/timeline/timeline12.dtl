Lux: Give it to me! I can handle it! Mother’s wrong—!
Fini: Lux, *stop*. This isn’t strength— it’s suicide!
Fini: Lux, *stop*. This isn’t strength— it’s suicide!
Lux: Then why you?! A machine can’t even *feel* what it means to protect her
Fini: … No Lux don’t go…

Player: I didn’t want this… I just…
Player: Alyra… Varek… don’t go…

Player (Normal): ...warm...light...
Maya_adult: Phina?! Phina! Nataly! She’s awake!
Nataly: No way—
Nataly: Phina…? You’re really awake?
Nataly: Ten years. We thought—
Player (Normal): Ten… years? What… happened…? Where…?
Maya_adult: You’re in the junkyard, in my room. You’ve been… sleeping.
Maya_adult: Everyone thought you’d never come back, but I knew! I told them—your heart—\
Your heart was still beating.
Player (Normal): But… I don’t have a heart.
Maya_adult: That never stopped you before.
Nataly: It’s… a lot to catch you up on.
Player (Normal): Alyra…? Varek…?
. . . . .  
Maya_adult: Alyra died... ten years ago. Protecting you.
Nataly: Varek disappeared right after. Nobody’s seen him since the battle. We searched for years.
Player (Normal): I remember… red skies… fire… then… darkness.
Nataly: Yeah. That darkness? It never left. The war didn’t stop — it got worse.
Nataly: Magus and Cyber leaders both blamed the other for the attack…
Maya_adult: They burned towns. Starved people. Even New Aerandale got split up.
Nataly: Then word started spreading…
Player (Normal): About me…?
Maya_adult: Some old spies found data during a battlefield sweep. From the war twenty years ago.\
They decrypted fragments. Found the truth.
Nataly: That you're Fini. That you carry the Sorcerech Core.
Player (Normal): ...But it’s corrupted.
Nataly: They don’t know that. Or they don’t care.
Nataly: You’re not a person to them anymore. You’re a weapon. A key. A threat.
Nataly: Not only that, At first only whispers. But after Exactlyion decrypted those battlefield scans... the whole world knew.
Maya_adult: That’s why Uncle Bettle and I joined the Revolutionary front.
Maya_adult: Not to start more war — but to protect New Aerandale. To protect you.
Player (Normal): You… protected me… for ten years?
Maya_adult: Every day. Repaired your systems. Kept you powered.\
Talked to you. Even when you didn’t respond, I knew you heard me.
Player (Normal): I heard… everything. Faint… but warm. Maya… thank you.
Maya_adult: Don’t thank me yet. We need you more than ever.\
People need something real to believe in again. And you're real.
Player (Normal): I feel… stronger. But colder, too.
Maya_adult: And me? I’ve been training. Ten years of magic. Ice and fire. I’m not just the kid from the junkyard anymore.
Player (Normal): You’ve grown… strong.
Maya_adult: Because I had to. For you.
Nataly: Listen. Things are worse now.\
The Magus and Cyber leaders won’t stop unless someone stands between them. Like Alyra & Varek tried to do
Player (Normal): Then we continue their journey.
Nataly: We will. But first… I need to tell you something.\
About Alyra. About what we were trying to do before it all fell apart.
Nataly: ...She always wanted peace. But we had different ways of chasing it.
